* NOTE:
Submissions to the Family History Department for Ancestral File submission or for clearing temple ordinances  must use a
DESTination of ANSTFILE or TempleReady, respectively.  
The header structure provides information about the entire transmission. The SOURce system name
identifies which system sent the data. The DESTination system name identifies the intended receiving
system.
Additional GEDCOM standards will be produced in the future to reflect GEDCOM expansion and
maturity. This requires the reading program to make sure it can read the GEDC.VERS and the
GEDC.FORM values to insure proper readability. The CHAR tag is required. All character codes
greater than 0x7F must be converted to ANSEL. (See Chapter 3, starting on page 77.)

The FAMily record is used to record marriages, common law marriages, and family unions caused by
two people becoming the parents of a child. There can be no more than one HUSB/father and one
WIFE/mother listed in each FAM_RECORD. If, for example, a man participated in more than one
family union, then he would appear in more than one FAM_RECORD. The family record structure
assumes that the HUSB/father is male and WIFE/mother is female.
The preferred order of the CHILdren pointers within a FAMily structure is chronological by birth.

The individual record is a compilation of facts, known or discovered, about an individual.  Sometimes
these facts are from different sources.  This form allows documentation of the source where each of
the facts were discovered.
The normal lineage links are shown through the use of pointers from the individual to a family
through either the FAMC tag or the FAMS tag.  The FAMC tag provides a pointer to a family where
this person is a child.  The FAMS tag provides a pointer to a family where this person is a spouse or
parent.  The <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> (see page 31) structure contains a FAMC pointer
which is required to show any child to parent linkage for pedigree navigation.  The
<<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> structure also indicates whether the pedigree link represents a
birth lineage, an adoption lineage, or a sealing lineage.
Linkage between a child and the family they belonged to at the time of an event can also be shown
by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the appropriate event.  For example, a FAMC pointer subordinate
to an adoption event indicates a relationship to family by adoption. Biological parents can be shown
by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the birth event(optional).
Other associations or relationships are represented by the ASSOciation tag.  The person's relation
or association is the person being pointed to. The association or relationship is stated by the value
on the subordinate RELA line.   For example:
0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME Fred/Jones/
1 ASSO @I2@
2 RELA Godfather

The BLOB context of the multimedia record was removed in version 5.5.1. A reference to a multimedia
file was added to the record structure.  The file reference occurs one to many times so that multiple files
can be grouped together, each pertaining to the same context. For example, if you wanted to associate a
sound clip and a photo, you would reference each multimedia file and indicate the format using the
FORM tag subordinate to each file reference.

The sending system uses a submission record to send instructions and information to the receiving
system. TempleReady processes submission records to determine which temple the cleared records
should be directed to. The submission record is also used for communication between Ancestral File
download requests and TempleReady. Each GEDCOM transmission file should have only one
submission record. Multiple submissions are handled by creating separate GEDCOM transmission
files.

The submitter record identifies an individual or organization that contributed information contained
in the GEDCOM transmission. All records in the transmission are assumed to be submitted by the
SUBMITTER referenced in the HEADer, unless a SUBMitter reference inside a specific record
points at a different SUBMITTER record.
* Note: submissions to the ancestral file require the name and address of the submitter.
