[<REGISTERED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>:<RECORD_IDENTIFIER>]
The record number that uniquely identifies this record within a registered network resource. The number will be usable as a cross-reference pointer. The use of the colon (:) is reserved to indicate the separation of the "registered resource identifier" (which precedes the colon) and the unique "record identifier" within that resource (which follows the colon). If the colon is used, implementations that check pointers should not expect to find a matching cross-reference identifier in the transmission but would find it in the indicated database within a network. Making resource files available to a public network is a future implementation.
PHONE_NUMBER:= {Size=1:25}
A phone number.
PHONETIC_TYPE:= {Size=5:30}
[{hangul}|{kana}|<USER_DEFINED>]
Indicates the method used in transforming the text to the phonetic variation. Can be a user-defined record method used to arrive at the phonetic variation of the name.

kana = Hiragana and/or Katakana characters were used in sounding the Kanji character used by Japanese.

PLACE_HIERARCHY:= {Size=1:120}
This shows the jurisdictional entities that are named in a sequence from the lowest to the highest jurisdiction. The jurisdictions are separated by commas, and any jurisdiction's name that is missing is still accounted for by a comma. When a PLAC.FORM structure is included in the HEADER of a GEDCOM transmission, it implies that all place names follow this jurisdictional format and each jurisdiction is accounted for by a comma, whether the name is known or not. When the PLAC.FORM is subordinate to an event, it temporarily overrides the implications made by the PLAC.FORM structure stated in the HEADER. This usage is not common and, therefore, not encouraged. It should only be used when a system has over-structured its place-names.
PLACE_LATITUDE:= {Size=5:8}

PLACE_NAME:= {Size=1:120}
[<PLACE_TEXT>|<PLACE_TEXT>, <PLACE_NAME>]
The jurisdictional name of the place where the event took place. Jurisdictions are separated by commas. If the actual jurisdictional names of these places have been identified, they can be shown using a PLAC.FORM structure either in the HEADER or in the event structure. (See <PLACE_HIERARCHY>.)
PLACE_PHONETIC_VARIATION:= {Size=1:120}
The phonetic variation of the place name is written in the same form as was the place name used in the superior <PLACE_NAME> primitive, but phonetically written using the method indicated by the subordinate <PHONETIC_TYPE> value.
PLACE_ROMANIZED_VARIATION:= {Size=1:120}
The romanized variation of the place name is written in the same form prescribed for the place name used in the superior <PLACE_NAME> context. The method used to romanize the name is indicated by the line_value of the subordinate <ROMANIZED_TYPE>.

The organization, institution, corporation, person, or other entity that has responsibility for the associated context.
RESTRICTION_NOTICE:= {Size=6:7}
[{confidential}|{locked}|{privacy}]
The restriction notice is defined for Ancestral File usage. Ancestral File download GEDCOM files may contain this data.
Where:
confidential = This data was marked as confidential by the user. In some systems data marked as confidential will be treated differently.
locked = Some records in Ancestral File have been satisfactorily proven by evidence, but because of source conflicts or incorrect traditions, there are repeated attempts to change this record. By arrangement, the Ancestral File Custodian can lock a record so that it cannot be changed without an agreement from the person assigned as the steward of such a record. The assigned steward is either the submitter listed for the record or Family History Support when no submitter is listed.
privacy = Indicate that information concerning this record is not present due to rights of or an approved request for privacy. In certain cases family records may also be marked with the RESN tag of privacy if either individual acting in the role of HUSB or WIFE is assumed living.

XREF:= {Size=1:22}
Either a pointer or an unique cross-reference identifier. If this element appears before the tag in a GEDCOM line, then it is a cross-reference identifier. If it appears after the tag in a GEDCOM line, then it is a pointer. The method of delimiting a pointer or cross-reference identifier is to enclose the pointer or cross-reference identifier within at signs (@). A XREF may not begin with a number sign (#). This is to avoid confusion with an escape sequence prefix (@#). The use of a colon (:) in the XREF is reserved for creating future network cross-references and the use of an exclamation (!) is reserved for intra-record pointers. Uniqueness of the cross-reference identifier is required within the transmission file.
